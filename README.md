# COFFEE-WEB
 It is a great way to learn the basics of HTML fundamentals and CSS styles and gain practical experience in creating and designing a website.

In this blog post, I will guide you through the process of creating an attractive, responsive coffee website using HTML and CSS. My website will focus on a coffee theme, but you can customize it. By creating this website, not only will you learn to create a website, but you’ll also learn how to structure web content properly and apply styling to make it responsive to different screen sizes.
